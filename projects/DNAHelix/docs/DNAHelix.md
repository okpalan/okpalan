# DNAHelix



DNAHelix is a creative coding project by me, Nnamdi Michael Okpala. Pramily, the objecct is to expliot the property of vector to simulate a DNAHelix in the most effiecent manner. I endured on this project as I believe it has it cavets.In the future,i aim to add more features to the projects.Note I aim to simulate the sturture of DNA not emulate the behaviour.DNA uses Base4 and traditonal computer uses base 2/

### What is DNA?

DNA stands for **Deoxyribonucleic acid**.It is building block for a cellbased live on earth,as is composed of 4 unique protein or code. These intrustion when paired in any combination give These are:

- Adenine

- Thymine

- Cytosine

- Guanine

In that regard, I hope to simulate common genetic sequence of animals and adopt it with larger dataset such as humans.
